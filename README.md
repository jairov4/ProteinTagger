[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/wvo7nd48iqmtpaev?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jairov4/proteintagger)

This application helps to tag biosequences from UniProt repositories in order to get high quality datasets for use with Machine Learning techniques. Many biosequences has different tags for same protein. For example, some chains are tagged as "HC-Pro" other as "Helper Component Proteinase", this application allow you quickly group many sequences under same tag and export your classification.

# How Use
- Load an UniProt dataset from XML file
- Tag proteins as you like
- Export your new information
